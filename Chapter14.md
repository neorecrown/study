# Chapter 14 CNN
## The Architecture of the Visual Cortex
Inspired by the study of structures of the visual cortex

## Convolutional Layers
1. Convolutional Layers connect to pixels in their receptive fields
2. In a CNN, the input images can be 2D
3. CNN, receptive fields: width, height, strides
4. Filters(convolution kernels)
